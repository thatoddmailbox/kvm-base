# kvm-base
The main board for the KVM switch I built. Contains HDMI and USB switch ICs, allowing you to share two monitors and four USB devices between three different computers.

It connects via a PS/2 cable to [kvm-keypad](https://github.com/thatoddmailbox/kvm-keypad)&mdash;however, it does _not_ use the actual PS/2 protocol.
